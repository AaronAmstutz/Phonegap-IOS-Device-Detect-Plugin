Phonegap IOS Device Detection Plugin
=================================

Right now I'm just using this to detect iPad version based on device capabilities (no camera on iPad 1, retina on iPad 3).

I haven't tested it on iPhone or iPod touch, but would love to and end up supporting them too. If you want to pull and add support for them, please do!
